    "> `agent_scratchpad` **must exist** in agent prompts that support tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "If `{agent_scratchpad}` is missing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tool calls may fail\n",
    "* Agent may loop\n",
    "* Errors like `KeyError: 'intermediate_steps'` appear\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Is `agent_scratchpad` shown to users?\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Should it be logged?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Yes (for debugging)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Should it be stored long-term?\n",

    "#### Manually passing `agent_scratchpad`\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always include `{agent_scratchpad}` in agent prompts\n",
    "* Never expose it in UI\n",
    "* Log it only in debug mode\n",
    "* Let LangChain manage it\n",
    "* Keep prompts minimal around it\n",

    "### Interview-Ready Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> “`agent_scratchpad` is an internal prompt variable that stores an agent’s intermediate reasoning steps and tool interactions, enabling multi-step decision-making. It is essential for agent execution but is hidden from users.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule of Thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chains → no scratchpad**\n",
    "* **Agents → scratchpad required**\n",
    "* **Users → never see it**\n",
    "* **Debugging → inspect it**"
