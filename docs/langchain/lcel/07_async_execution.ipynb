It is essential for learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and overall functioning in daily life. Memory can be divided into three main stages: encoding, storage, and retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Encoding: This is the initial process of receiving and processing information from the environment. The brain takes in sensory input through the senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) and converts it into a form that can be stored and recalled later. Different types of encoding include visual, auditory, semantic, and procedural encoding.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Storage: Once information is encoded, it is stored in various regions of the brain for later retrieval. There are several different types of memory storage, including sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory holds a brief snapshot of incoming sensory information, short-term memory temporarily stores information for immediate use, and long-term memory stores information over an extended period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Retrieval: This is the process of recalling stored information from memory when needed. Retrieval can be influenced by various factors, such as the strength of the memory trace, context cues, emotional associations, and interference from other memories. There are different retrieval strategies that can be employed to enhance memory recall, such as rehearsal, organization, visualization, and mnemonic devices.\n",
