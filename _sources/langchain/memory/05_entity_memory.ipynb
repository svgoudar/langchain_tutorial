    "## Entity Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity Memory** is a memory mechanism that **extracts, tracks, and updates facts about entities** (people, systems, products, organizations, issues) mentioned during a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing raw chat history, it stores **structured knowledge about entities** and their attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional memories focus on *conversation flow*.\n",
    "Entity memory focuses on *facts*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It solves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repetition (“Which OS again?”)\n",
    "* Loss of important details in summaries\n",
    "* Inefficient long-term recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Entity: User\n",
    "  - OS: Windows 11\n",
    "  - Issue: VPN disconnects\n",
    "  - Frequency: Every 5 minutes\n",

    "\n",
    "### How Entity Memory Works Internally\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LLM scans each turn\n",
    "2. Identifies entities (noun phrases)\n",
    "3. Extracts or updates facts about entities\n",
    "4. Stores them in a structured store\n",
    "5. Injects relevant entity facts into future prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"My VPN disconnects on Windows 11\"\n",
    "→ Entity: VPN (Issue: disconnects)\n",
    "→ Entity: OS (Windows 11)\n",
